//? controller comment
//Todo list:
/* 
    * Make add comment function (return: commentType so we can add it in controllers/book.ts)*
    ? Make UpVote function (return: true | false, if true then it's higher, if false then it's lower)?
    * Make get comment (return: commentType[](the algorithm is from higher to lower upvote)*
*/
//Good Luck :)
